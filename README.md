        <h1>Snake Game</h1>
        <p>This is a simple Snake game implemented in Java using Swing for the graphical interface. The game allows the player to control a snake to eat apples and grow in length. The objective is to avoid collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.</p
        <h2>Features:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Snake Movement:</strong> Control the snake's direction using arrow keys.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple Eating:</strong> Increase the snake's length by eating apples that randomly appear on the board.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Over and Restart:</strong> When the snake collides with the wall or itself, the game ends. Pressing the "Enter" key restarts the game.</li>
            <li><strong>Score Display:</strong> The game displays the current score based on the number of apples eaten.</li>
